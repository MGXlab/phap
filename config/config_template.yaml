# The default "all" string runs them all
# If you want to run a subset supply them as a list
# For example, the following will run rafah and wish only
# Tools are aliased as 'vhmnet', 'rafah', 'htp', 'wish', 'vhulk', 'crispropendb'
# and 'phist'. You could run a subset of the tools like this:
# tools:
#    - rafah
#    - wish
tools: all
